Task 1: No code.
Task 2: Simple parsing
Task 3: Absolute pain


Notes for safely-conducting-shenanigans:

TO PREVENT SHORTING THE AVR128DB48:

Turning on:
Power the Arduino first, wait until it finishes blinking, and turns on the LED on Pin 13 constantly (to indicate stability).
Then, power the AVR128DB48
Then, add the wire from TX to C1

Turning off:
Remove the TX to C1 wire
Turn off the AVR128DB48
Turn off the Arduino
